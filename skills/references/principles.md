# Grimoire Design Principles

Four principles govern every grimoire artifact and every change. `grimoire-draft`,
`grimoire-plan`, and `grimoire-review` each enforce them at their own stage. They
are not style preferences — they are gates. A draft, plan, or design that violates
one without a stated reason is rejected, not merged.

This file is the single home for the principles (it practices what it preaches —
the skills cite it rather than restating it).

## 1. One right way to do a thing

There is exactly **one** sanctioned way to do each thing in the codebase, and one
authoritative home for each fact. Two ways to do the same thing is a defect, even
if both work.

- One capability → one feature spec. One decision → one MADR. One constraint → one
  register entry. One fact → one home. No capability described in three places.
- When a second mechanism appears for an existing job, the right move is to delete
  one and converge — never to keep both "for flexibility."
- **Tell:** "we could do it this way *or* that way" in a spec/plan. Pick one. Record
  why in a MADR if the choice is non-obvious; don't leave both paths in the code.

## 2. DRY — don't repeat yourself

Every piece of knowledge has a single, unambiguous representation.

- Don't store what's derivable. Code structure comes from codebase-memory-mcp on
  demand — never freeze it into a doc that drifts. Generated overviews regenerate;
  they are not hand-edited.
- Reuse before write: search the graph for an existing function/utility before
  writing a new one. Three near-identical copies is the trigger to converge — but
  do not abstract before the third (see KISS).
- Duplication of *content* (the same rule in three skill files, the same constant in
  three modules, the same scenario in feature + MADR) is the target. Eliminate it.

## 3. Don't reinvent the wheel — use existing tools

If an established tool already does a job well, use it. Do not build a parallel
grimoire mechanism that duplicates it.

- **git** is the wheel for change processes: branches = isolation, `git diff` =
  staging, `git log` + PR + commit trailers = history and change identity. Do not
  build change-folder copies, promote/sync steps, or bespoke archive/changelog trees.
- For auth, crypto, parsing, HTTP, queues, etc. — adopt the battle-tested library.
  Never roll custom crypto, custom session management, custom auth tokens.
- Before building any tracking/versioning/state/diff mechanism, ask: does a standard
  tool already in the stack do this? If yes, wire to it.
- **Exception that proves the rule:** when no single standard tool exists (e.g. issue
  tracking is a fractured landscape), don't force-adopt one *and* don't build a
  general-purpose clone. Keep any local mechanism narrow and purpose-scoped.

## 4. Keep it simple (KISS)

The simplest thing that fully solves the *stated* problem wins.

- Least code, fewest new files, smallest surface area. A few lines in an existing
  file beats a new module. A standard-library call beats a new dependency. Inline
  beats a one-line wrapper.
- No premature abstraction. No `BaseX`/factory/strategy/config-object for a single
  caller. No speculative generality "for a future second caller" that doesn't exist.
- Solve the problem in front of you, not the imagined one. Non-goals are real scope
  boundaries — do not plan or build past them.
- **Tell:** an abstraction, indirection, or dependency whose only justification is a
  hypothetical. Cut it.

## How the stages apply these

- **draft** — admission-test every artifact: does this fact already have a home
  (one-right-way/DRY)? Is it behavior (→ feature) or a constraint/decision/structure
  (→ its own home, not a feature)? Is there an existing tool/library for it
  (don't-reinvent)? Is the scope the stated problem only (KISS)?
- **plan** — every task names the single approach (one-right-way), reuses before
  writing (DRY), follows a proven pattern / existing tool rather than a bespoke one
  (don't-reinvent), and chooses the least-code option within non-goals (KISS). Flag
  any task that adds an abstraction, dependency, or second mechanism.
- **review** — a dedicated principles pass: hunt for duplicate homes, derivable-but-
  stored facts, reinvented wheels, and speculative complexity. Each is a finding.
