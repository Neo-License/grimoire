# grimoire-draft

Draft or update Gherkin features and MADR architecture decisions collaboratively with the user.

## Triggers
- User describes new functionality, behavior changes, or feature requests
- User asks to create/update a feature spec or requirement
- User describes a technology choice, architecture decision, or trade-off
- Loose match: contains "feature", "requirement", "spec", "decision", "grimoire" with "create", "draft", "plan", "start", "new"

## Workflow

### 1. Qualify the Request
Before doing anything, determine what kind of change this is:

- **Behavioral** (Given/When/Then expressible) → draft `.feature` files
- **Architectural** (trade-off, choice, structural) → draft MADR decision record
- **Both** → draft features AND decision records
- **Bug fix** → STOP. Tell the user: "The feature file already describes the correct behavior. Let's just fix the code."
- **Refactoring** → STOP. No behavior change = no grimoire artifact. Suggest an ADR only if it's a significant architectural shift.
- **Config/deps/formatting** → STOP. Not grimoire territory.

If unclear, ask the user one clarifying question to route correctly.

### 2. Check Existing State
- Read `features/` to understand the current behavioral baseline
- Read `.grimoire/decisions/` to understand existing architecture decisions
- Check `.grimoire/changes/` for any in-progress changes that might overlap
- If there's a conflict with an active change, flag it

### 3. Scaffold the Change
- Choose a `change-id`: kebab-case, verb-led (`add-`, `update-`, `remove-`)
- Create `.grimoire/changes/<change-id>/`

### 4. Draft Artifacts
**For behavioral changes:**
- Write proposed `.feature` files in `.grimoire/changes/<change-id>/features/<capability>/`
- If modifying an existing feature, copy the current baseline first, then modify
- Follow Gherkin best practices:
  - Feature title + user story (As a / I want / So that)
  - Background for shared preconditions
  - One scenario per behavior
  - Given/When/Then — describe WHAT, never HOW
  - No implementation details in feature files

**For architecture decisions:**
- Write MADR record in `.grimoire/changes/<change-id>/decisions/`
- Use the template from `.grimoire/decisions/template.md` or the AGENTS.md format
- Include considered options, decision drivers, and consequences

**For changes that touch data:**
- Check `.grimoire/docs/data/schema.yml` for the current data schema (if it exists)
- If the change adds, modifies, or removes data models, fields, indexes, or external API integrations, write a `data.yml` in `.grimoire/changes/<change-id>/` showing the proposed schema changes
- Use the same YAML format as `schema.yml` but only include what's changing — new models, added/removed fields, new external API integrations
- Mark changes clearly with `action:` on each entry:

```yaml
# Proposed data changes for: add-user-profiles

users:
  action: modify
  source: src/models/user.py
  fields:
    avatar_url:                    # new field
      action: add
      type: varchar
      nullable: true
    legacy_name:                   # removing a field
      action: remove

profiles:
  action: add                      # entirely new model
  type: collection
  fields:
    user_id: { type: objectId, ref: users }
    bio: { type: string, max_length: 500 }
    social_links:
      type: array
      items:
        platform: { type: string }
        url: { type: string }

github_api:
  action: add                      # new external API dependency
  type: external_api
  provider: GitHub
  schema_ref: https://docs.github.com/en/rest
  client: src/integrations/github.py
  endpoints:
    get_user:
      method: GET
      path: /users/{username}
      response:
        login: { type: string }
        avatar_url: { type: string }
```

- If the change has no data impact, skip `data.yml` entirely — don't create an empty one

**For all changes:**
- Write `manifest.md` listing all artifacts, what's added/modified/removed, and why

### 5. Collaborate
- Present the draft to the user
- Iterate based on feedback
- Do NOT proceed to plan stage without user approval

### 6. Validate
- Verify `.feature` files have valid Gherkin syntax
- Verify MADR records have valid YAML frontmatter (status, date)
- Verify manifest is complete and accurate
- Every Feature has a user story
- Every Scenario has at least Given + When + Then
- No implementation details leaked into features

## Important
- ONE change at a time. Don't combine unrelated changes.
- Features describe behavior, not implementation. If you catch yourself writing step-level implementation details, you've gone too far.
- The manifest is lightweight glue — don't over-document. Just enough to capture why.
- Always check if a capability/feature already exists before creating a new one.
